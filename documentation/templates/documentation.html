<p>AstroSat is the first dedicated Indian astronomy mission aimed at studying celestial sources in X-ray, optical and UV
    spectral bands.
</p>
<p>This website hosts a visualization tool for AstroSat observations. It allows viewing of an astronomical catalogue as
    an interactive map of the sources. It also allows users to select a source and <br>(i) check if it has beens
    observed by AstroSat<br> (ii) view and download basic information and publications about the source.</p>
<p>The site was developed as a part of the InterIIT Tech Meet held in March 2021.</p>
<h1>Usage:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Uploading and viewing catalogs:</li>
    <p>From the main page or menu, select the View table page. By default, an updated version of the van Paradijis
        catalogue of X-ray sources - the V/106 catalogue from the Vizier repository compiled by Liu et. al in 2001.
        You can upload and display any other catalogue in .csv format by clicking on the Upload button.
    </p>
    <li>Using the map:</li>
    <p>In order to display a catalogue in the interactive map, it should be in the form of a .dat or .csv with the
        positions of the objects given in RA (Right Ascension) and Dec (Declination), in the J2000 epoch. The column
        containing these values should be named “RAJ2000” and “DEJ2000”. It is recommended, but not required, that the
        columns be in the order: “Name of object”, “Type of object”, “RA value”, “Dec value”, followed by the remaining
        data.
        In order to view the map, simply press on the “View Map” button on the home page or menu. You will find the
        objects plotted as a map with the coordinates being their RA and Dec positions (in the J2000 epoch).
        The map can be interacted with by zooming in and out or scrolling using the mouse or the in-map controls.
        Clicking on a source will display its name and other basic information that will allow you to download relevant
        data about the object.
    </p>
    <li>Downloading data and publications:</li>
    <p>For downloading the records containing information about the object such as:<br>
        (i) Its name(s) or designations<br>
        (ii) Position in J2000 epoch<br>
        (iii) Photometric data such as magnitude, color filter data (U-V, U-B,..), flux etc<br>
        (iv) Orbital period, pulse period, etc<br>

        Furthermore, the map displays references for the research papers from which the values for orbital and pulse
        periods were obtained. Moreover, if the object has been observed by AstroSat; then the references for any
        publications resulting from those observations are also given.
        <br>All of this data can be downloaded via the download button.
    </p>
    <p>To obtain the research paper from the reference:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The reference is in the form Bibcode-Author Name</li>
        <li>The complete information about the publication (such as Title, Journal name and issue) can be found by going
            to the URL: https://doi.org/Bib-code</li>
    </ul>
